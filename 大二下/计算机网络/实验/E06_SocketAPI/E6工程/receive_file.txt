《Annabel
Lee》
Edgar
Allan
Poe
(1809-1849）
It
was
many
and
many
a
year
ago,
In
a
kingdom
by
the
sea,
That
a
maiden
there
lived
whom
you
may
know
By
the
name
of
ANNABEL
LEE;
And
this
maiden
she
lived
with
no
other
thought
Than
to
love
and
be
loved
by
me.
She
was
a
child
and
I
was
a
child,
In
this
kingdom
by
the
sea;
But
we
loved
with
a
love
that
was
more
than
love
I
and
my
Annabel
Lee;
With
a
love
that
the
winged
seraphs
of
heaven
coveted
her
and
me.
And
this
was
the
reason
that,
long
ago,
In
this
kingdom
by
the
sea，
A
wind
blew
out
of
a
cloud
by
night
chilling
my
Annabel
Lee;
So
that
her
highborn
kingsman
came
And
bore
her
away
from
me,
To
shut
her
up
in
a
sepulchre
In
this
kingdom
by
the
sea.
The
angels,
not
half
so
happy
in
the
heaven,
Went
evnying
her
and
me
Yes!
That
was
the
reason(as
all
men
know,
in
this
kingdom
by
the
sea)
That
the
wind
came
out
of
the
cloud,
Chilling
and
killing
my
Annabel
Lee.
But
our
love
it
was
stronger
by
far
than
the
love
Of
those
who
were
older
than
we
Of
many
far
wiser
than
we
And
neither
the
angels
in
heaven
above，
Nor
the
demons
down
under
the
sea，
Can
ever
dissever
my
soul
from
the
soul
Of
the
beautiful
Annabel
Lee.
For
the
moon
never
beams
without
bringing
me
dreams
Of
the
beautiful
Annalbel
Lee;
And
the
stars
never
rise
but
I
see
the
bright
eyes
Of
the
beautiful
Annabel
Lee;
And
so,
all
the
night-tide,
I
lie
down
by
the
side
Of
my
darling,
my
darling,
my
life
and
my
bride,
In
the
sepulchre
there
by
the
sea,
In
her
tomb
by
the
side
of
the
sea.
